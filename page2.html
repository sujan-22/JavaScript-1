                    <p>And Still I Rise poem is all about self-respect and self-confidence. I understand how she conquered everything
                        with self-esteem and she shows nothing can get her down if she decides to rise</p>
                
                    <p>"And Still I Rise", Maya's poem that says about strength of the human spirit and the resilience in the face 
                        of adversity. The poem is a powerful tribute to the resilience of African Americans and 
                        their determination to rise above the difficulties they have faced throughout history. The poem encourages 
                        readers to remain strong and to keep pushing forward in the face of any obstacle. It is a reminder that no 
                        matter how much difficulty you face in the life, there is always the possibility of rising above it.</p>
